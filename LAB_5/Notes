getpid() -->get id of the process
getppid() -->get of the parent process

init is the main process in linux. Its ID is 1.(parents ka parent)

Id of `/` (Swapper) root process is 0;

ORPHAN: Parent terminates first. Child process becomes orphan.

Zombie Process: A process that has terminated but its entry is still there
    in the process table.
    to check the entry of ps `ps -ef` (defunctional)

    child terminates without sending signal to parent.
    do not write wait() parent section and use sleep() so child terminates
    first.

Q4. Simulate cp command. Open one file in Rd mode another in WR mode.
    Perform a copy function.

Q5. Simulate mv command

Used write(1, buff, size) to print at stdout.

Use unlink() system call to delete the file. (simulate mv command)



##dup system call

It assigns a duplicate file descriptor
OS always chooses the lowest number from the file descriptor table.

fd2 = dup(fd1)


ls > file.txt

fd = open("file.txt", O_CREAT | O_RWONLY);
close(1)  #close stdout
execlp("bin/ls", "ls", NULL);
dup(fd1);

<------OR------>

fd = open("file.txt", O_CREAET | O_RWONLY);
close(1)  #close stdout
dup(fd1);
execlp("bin/ls", "ls", NULL);

Q. Simulate wc < file1.txt > file2.txt
